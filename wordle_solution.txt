This is the guide to playing a perfect game of Wordle!

It was written in a single afternoon while I sat at a coffeeshop and may contain errors.
But if it does contain errors it's really your fault for trying to cheat at Wordle in
the first place. =)

Follow me at https://twitter.com/pouchmouse for updates.

This guide uses a code to represent the results of each guess:
  '0' means that the letter in this position did not match.
  '1' means that the letter in this position was in the correct word, but not at this position.
  '2' means that the letter in this position is fully correct.

You should begin by guessing 'raise'. If you do that...
